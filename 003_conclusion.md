The colonization of Africa by European powers was driven by several factors, unique to the colonial power. The Belgian Congo was motivated by the extraction of resources for trade as well as the exploitation of the labor force. France wanted to gain land to profit from the resources in the colonies while assimilating the Africans into French culture. Lastly, the United Kingdom was driven by economic gain through resource collection, territorial expansion, and the spread of Christianity and European values. While the extraction of resources is often said to be the main motivation for African colonization, each European country had its own distinct motive. Alongside this, they each took a different strategic approach to achieve their goals. The Belgian Congo took a more exploitative and centralized approach while France adopted a more assimilationist and direct approach and the United Kingdom took a more economic and indirect approach. 



These varying motivations and strategies had varying impacts on African economies, political structures, and social systems. The Belgian Congo exploited their natural resources and enacted forced labor systems which devastated the local economy and led to a decline in the population. Similarly, France extracted natural resources, imposed forced labor systems, and replaced the local cultural practices and language through their assimilation policies. The United Kingdom spread European culture and Christian values often rooted in Darwinism to the African population. As well as eradicated the native culture and language, exploited the natural resources and took control of the Suez Canal which led to a decline in the local economy. Understanding these motivations helps us understand the impact of European colonization on Africa and helps us have a clearer and broader understanding of the history.
