History is complex, and the reasoning behind the European colonization of the vast majority of Africa was not based on one driver, but a rich tapestry of incentives. European colonial efforts were widespread, ranging from Belgium’s brutal subjugation of the Congo in Central Africa, France’s efforts in West Africa, and Britain’s hold over nearly a third of the continent’s population from Cape Town, South Africa to Cairo, Egypt. These cases each have distinguishing characteristics representative of their histories, but share many of the same economic, social, and political motivations. 

European powers sought to dominate the continent for economic reasons such as trade and increase to valuable resources, social causes such as missionary work and new 19th century theories of social darwinism, and political justifications of nationalism and political influence. However, these varying efforts did not come without consequence as despite colonization being a lucrative effort for Europeans, the African people experienced varying levels of brutality and strife, ranging from bad to worse for decades on end.
