## **Analysis One, French Colonialism in Africa**

  The history of French presence in Africa started before the actual period dubbed “The Scramble for Africa”, although at a much smaller scale. In the 17th century, France mainly introduced outposts in Madagascar, Senegal, and the Mascarene Islands. These outposts were created to capitalize off slavery, and to gain access to large swaths of natural resources, such as nuts. Later during the Seven Years War, British forces caused turbulence for these French starter colonies, chiefly in Senegal. Although France had constructed some outposts in Africa early on, it would not truly colonize until the mid 1800s with its presence in Algeria.  
  
The French first invaded Algeria in 1830, and a full military operation was in order for nearly the next three decades. The French first utilized its navy to form a blockade around Algiers, then taking an approach through land with its army. Although forces within Algeria attempted to resist this military occupation, the French utilized sheer military power, as well as beneficial treaties with some Algerian nationalists, to carry out their conquest. In 1837, French forces toppled Algerian nationalist forces within Constantine, and continued engagements even into neighboring Morocco. Fighting would not halt until the early 1850s, with approximately half a million Algerians dead, and around 100,000 French dead. This conquest proved to be deadly to the natives, and droves of Europeans began to travel to the new colony<sup>1</sup>. After this conquest, Algeria was converted into a colony of France, with European settlers traveling to the colony to utilize the land. France would continue to rule most of Algeria for decades to come, occasionally encountering revolts by the native Algerians<sup>2</sup>. These efforts were not enough to quell the forces of France however, and in 1902, the French would ultimately go on to rule all of Algeria. 

Although Algeria was a large example of French presence during the “Scramble for Africa”, France also exerted its power in large parts of West Africa. Utilizing Senegal as a “home base”, France colonized surrounding areas such as Guinea and the Ivory Coast. In the late 1800s, France grouped these holdings together into one federation, French West Africa, encompassing Senegal, Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Niger, Mauritania, French Sudan, Upper Volta, and Dahomey. These areas previously came under French control through military expansion, and occasionally agreements with local leaders. Traveling along the Senegal River, French forces would push on in gathering land for themselves, trying to expand their influence as much as possible rather than consolidating the land they already had gained. Eventually, under the new “French West Africa”, a colonial governor was appointed within Senegal to oversee the entire federation. Further positions of power were added in each specific area at a smaller level, to ensure strict power over each.

  The French were of course motivated by economic reasons in colonizing these areas. By capturing large amounts of land and ruling over it as one, the French hoped to construct large scale operations to generate economic benefit. For example, nut and cotton cultivation were operations the French underwent to generate profit. Although the French generated profit, the native Africans themselves did not receive this same benefit. With slavery outlawed at this time, other forms of forced labor were at times used in order to maximize output. Furthermore, motives of scientific racism and views of the African natives as inferior, only fueled French aims to capture land. The French, like many other European powers, viewed themselves as on a “civilizing mission” to the inhabitants of Africa<sup>3</sup>. 

  The French also led intrusions into Morocco and Tunisia, further widening their colonial holdings. In 1881, France invaded Tunisia by utilizing its proximity to Algeria. Troops were sent to subjugate the Tunisian inhabitants, and a protectorate was instated through the signing of the Treaty of Bardo<sup>4</sup>. The conquest of Morocco took significantly longer than in the case of Tunisia, beginning in 1907, and not fully coming under French control until 1934. The French, as in Tunisia, established a protectorate in 1912 through the signing of the Treaty of Fes, between France and the Sultan of Morocco. In both cases of protectorates, local autonomy was lessened, enlarging French control over each region. However, these protectorates still allowed significantly more independence than in other French holdings, such as Algeria, due to their status as protectorates.

However, these protectorates still allowed significantly more independence than in other French holdings, such as Algeria, due to their status as protectorates.  

 French presence in Africa was relatively long-term, but not permanent. Although France had constructed large-scale operations intended to derive profit and labor, it become more and more difficult to maintain these colonial holdings. The fight for independence was at the forefront of many colonies and their native inhabitants, especially directly after the second World War<sup>5</sup>. In 1944 during the midst of the war, Charles de Gaulle, among leaders of Free France and governors of the French African colonies, organized a meeting to discuss the status of the colonies and establish potential changes to the ways they were governed. Although many key reforms within the colonies were proposed such as equal rights for citizens, and economic reforms, the outright suggestion of overall colonial independence was denied<sup>6</sup>. With this denial of independence to the colonies by de Gaulle, many of these African colonies became increasingly defiant in the years following. These colonial holdings would continue to experience strife, and difficulty maintaining a national identity due to French occupation. As these cracks continued to appear, various colonies were able to eventually attain independence in the 1950s and 1960s. Although independence was attained at these times, these areas would still experience difficulties, feeling the effects of colonization even after its end.  
  

## **Analysis Two, British Colonialism in Africa**

  The colonization of Africa by European powers was driven by the desire for resources, strategic control, and influence over vast territories. Along the east coast of Africa, the United Kingdom pursued valuable resources such as oil, rubber, and ivory, while also pursuing new land for settlement and agriculture. This push for economic gain and expansion was accompanied by an effort to impose European cultural and social norms on African societies, a mission rooted in ideologies like Social Darwinism and racial superiority. Missionaries, particularly in South Africa, played a complex role in spreading Christianity and European customs, often undermining traditional African practices. Furthermore, English control of the Suez Canal became an important factor in securing trade routes through Africa. This led to heightened tensions with other colonial powers. 

  One of the most important parts of Britain's empire was the colonization of South Africa. The British were able to take control of South Africa in 1795 (Nel, Andreis, British Occupation of the Cape). From there they were able to use this colony as a doorway into India and all of Asia. The strategic location gave safe passage for English merchants to and from Asia and Africa. While there was a lot of trade coming from Asia, South Africa was also good at producing their own resources. Some major resources that came from South Africa were things like ivory, diamonds, and gold. These helped boost the British colony, funding their exploitation and colonization. Ivory is a hard white material that comes from elephants and some of the only places to find it is in Africa especially in the South of Africa where most of them live. The ivory trade was so popular that it was to rival the slave trade and even be more valuable because of how much demand there was for it. 

  South Africa became one of the biggest diamond and gold operations in the world which benefited the British economy heavily. Diamonds are a rare substance that were found mainly in Brazil and India until 1867 when someone found Diamonds in the Orange River sparking a Diamond rush (History of Diamonds: Shimansky). Gold was a minor operation in Africa with some being found in the 1850s, but in the late 1880s on a farm outside of Johannesburg a big load of gold was found starting a major mining operation (Kirk, Jason, The Origin of Gold in South Africa). This helped increase the value of South Africa because the trade route and using South Africa as a pit stop was soon coming to an end with the Suez Canal up for grabs. 

  Near the end of the century one of the most important parts of Africa was finding the best trade routes. The Suez Canal located in Egypt was a key route that many nations fought over to control. In 1859 the French helped the Egyptians start the construction of the canal that would go all the way until 1869. The total cost of the canal at the time cost about $100 million dollars and would translate roughly to $1.5 billion in today’s cost(Suez Canal ‑ Crisis, Location & Egypt.). The British were able to buy 44% of the shares of the Suez Canal from an Egyptian shareholder leaving the French shareholders to still hold a majority of 56% of the shares. The 44% that the English were able to buy was enough though to be able to ban Russia from using the passage. In 1882 riots broke out in Egypt killing English citizens and infuriating the United Kingdom. They decided to step in because they felt that the weak Ottoman Empire was not strong enough to keep peace. So, they decided to intervene and invade Egypt. Once the United Kingdom invaded Egypt, they were able to gain full control over the Canal for the time. In 1888 the Convention of Constantinople was called on where multiple countries including France, Germany, English, Austrian Hungarian, and Ottomans joined. The convention was called because it was to decide the fate of the Suez Canal because it was too valuable, and tensions were growing between nations on who the rightful owner of it should be. The outcome from it was that it shall remain under British protection, but it will be neutral territory for any nation no matter if it is during peace or war times (Constantinople Convention). This allowed for free trade to go through benefiting many countries, especially smaller countries. 

  English colonial endeavors in South Africa, driven by ideas of social Darwinism and a sense of racial superiority, sought to transform African society along European lines. Social Darwinism promoted the idea that Africans were at a lower level of human evolution and that European culture was fundamentally superior by misapplying Darwin's theory of natural selection to human societies. This rationale made it possible for English colonial rulers to force their religion, culture, and values on African communities while frequently ignoring native customs and beliefs. This "civilizing" effort was heavily influenced by missionaries, especially in South Africa. English missionaries believed that Christianity would "save" the local people from what they perceived to be "savage" or immoral customs, thus they worked to convert them. Native languages and traditions were gradually replaced by English, Christianity, and European conventions taught to African youngsters in mission schools. Despite their seeming altruism, missionaries contributed to the solidification of racial hierarchies and the closer alignment of African communities with European colonial goals, resulting in profound and enduring cultural transformations. 

  In conclusion, Africa was significantly and permanently impacted by colonization, especially by the British. Exploiting natural riches like diamonds, gold, and ivory, the British achieved authority over regions like South Africa, motivated by the desire for resources, economic gain, and strategic influence. Many native customs and languages were eradicated during this time as European powers forced their culture and ideology—which was frequently based on social Darwinism—on African societies. British domination was further highlighted by their strategic control of the Suez Canal, which changed trade routes and the world economy. African societies were significantly changed by British colonialism, even though it was presented as a mission of civilization. The socio-economic landscape of Africa is still impacted by this era, serving as a reminder of the colonial past's enduring repercussions. 

## Analysis Three, **Belgium and the Congo**

  The Belgian occupation of the Congo began on November 15, 1908, when Belgium officially annexed the Congo Free State, transforming it into the Belgian Congo<sup>1</sup>. This moment marked the end of King Leopold II's personal dominion over the territory, a period infamous for the atrocities committed under his rule. Leopold’s policies of forced labor and resource exploitation had garnered widespread international condemnation, prompting demands for reform and the eventual transfer of authority to the Belgian state. The annexation of the Congo followed a series of pivotal events and diplomatic maneuvers within the broader European context of colonialism. The contest over the Congo had its roots in the 1884–85 Berlin Conference, during which European powers formalized their imperial claims to African territories<sup>2</sup>. King Leopold II, acting as the head of the International African Association, a supposed humanitarian organization, secured international recognition of his claim to the Congo. Leopold portrayed his efforts as philanthropic, promising to promote civilization and curb the slave trade. In reality, his administration established an exploitative system, particularly centered around the lucrative rubber trade. Under Leopold’s rule, the local population was subjected to forced labor, violent repression, and systematic plunder of resources, leading to the deaths of millions of Congolese people. The horrors of Leopold’s regime were gradually brought to light by a growing humanitarian movement. Activists such as E.D. Morel and Roger Casement were central figures in this campaign. Morel, a British journalist, exposed the extent of the exploitation and abuses through investigative reports and public advocacy<sup>3</sup>. Casement, a British consul, documented the atrocities in what became known as the Casement Report, providing graphic evidence of the suffering inflicted upon the Congolese population. Photographs and testimonies included in these reports ignited outrage in Europe and the United States, prompting calls for intervention. The Congo Reform Association, spearheaded by Morel and Casement, played a vital role in sustaining international pressure against Leopold’s rule1. Their efforts inspired widespread condemnation of the Congo Free State, forcing Belgium’s parliament to confront the issue. By the early 20th century, domestic and international pressure had made Leopold’s continued control over the Congo untenable. Reluctantly, Leopold agreed to cede the territory to the Belgian government in exchange for financial compensation. This agreement ensured that his personal economic interests in the region remained largely intact, even as he was removed from political authority. The annexation of the Congo by Belgium followed heated debates among Belgian political leaders. Figures like Prime Minister Jules de Trooz and his successor François Schollaert had to navigate complex domestic and international challenges to formalize the transfer of power<sup>1</sup>. Belgium sought to reframe its control over the Congo as a moral obligation, presenting itself as a more humane and responsible colonial administrator compared to Leopold. This rhetoric was aimed at deflecting criticism while justifying the continuation of colonial rule. Once the Belgian state assumed control, it implemented a centralized colonial administrative structure. This new governance system, while less overtly brutal than Leopold’s personal regime, continued to prioritize the extraction of resources over the welfare of the Congolese people. Infrastructure development, such as railroads and ports, was largely geared toward facilitating economic exploitation. The local population remained subject to oppressive policies, including forced labor and high taxation, which perpetuated their suffering under Belgian rule. The annexation of the Congo illustrates the intricate interplay of humanitarian advocacy, political maneuvering, and economic interests that characterized European colonialism. Humanitarian efforts led by figures like Morel and Casement successfully galvanized global attention, forcing Belgium to act against Leopold. However, the transition to Belgian state control did not fundamentally alter the exploitative nature of colonialism in the Congo. Instead, it marked a shift from personal to institutionalized exploitation, with Belgium profiting from the territory’s vast resources at the expense of its inhabitants. This historical episode underscores the duality of European colonial narratives: public claims of humanitarianism often masked systems of domination and economic extraction. While the annexation ostensibly ended the worst abuses of Leopold’s reign, it failed to deliver justice or significant improvement for the Congolese people, whose lives continued to be shaped by the enduring legacy of colonialism. 
  
Belgium faced many challenges while establishing its colonial rule over the Congo. Much of it was marked by the resistance of local populations and the logistical difficulties of governing such a vast territory. The rise of local rebellions presented a massive obstacle as Congolese communities resisted foreign occupation and exploitation of their vast resources<sup>1</sup>. These uprisings were caused by the brutal practices of Belgian soldiers and concession companies left after the Belgian annex of the Congo, who enforced terrible labor conditions. The Congolese endured widespread violence, including forced labor, amputations, and other forms of coercion, and decimated entire communities4. Additionally, the Belgian administration struggled to maintain effective control over the region, given the Congo's massive size, challenging terrain to traverse, and limited infrastructure. All this hindered communication and enforcement of authority over the native populations. Even with these problems the motivations for colonizing the Congo came from the economic opportunities presented by the region's abundant natural resources. In the early 20th century, rubber emerged as one of the most valuable commodities globally, driven by the rapid industrialization and the rise of the automobile industry. The Congo's rich rubber resources represented a significant economic boon for Belgium, particularly during King Leopold II's reign, when the colony was initially his personal possession1. Leopold’s administration pursued the exploitation of rubber through a system of forced labor, extracting immense profits at the cost of human lives and suffering. For Belgium, the Congo not only symbolized economic enrichment but also national prestige, as European powers competed for colonial dominance in Africa. The goal of transforming the Congo into an economic hub for rubber and other resources was for Belgium to solidify its position on the global stage. This combination of economic ambition and human exploitation defined Belgium's colonization of the Congo, with the drive for profit starkly juxtaposed against the profound hardships imposed on the Congolese people, whose resilience continually challenged the colonial regime.
