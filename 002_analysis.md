Analysis One, French Colonialism in Africa

  The history of French presence in Africa started before the actual period dubbed “The Scramble for Africa”, although at a much smaller scale. In the 17th century, France mainly introduced outposts in Madagascar, Senegal, and the Mascarene Islands. These outposts were created to capitalize off slavery, and to gain access to large swaths of natural resources, such as nuts. Later during the Seven Years War, British forces caused turbulence for these French starter colonies, chiefly in Senegal. Although France had constructed some outposts in Africa early on, it would not truly colonize until the mid 1800s with its presence in Algeria.  

  The French first invaded Algeria in 1830, and a full military operation was in order for nearly the next three decades. The French first utilized its navy to form a blockade around Algiers, then taking an approach through land with its army. Although forces within Algeria attempted to resist this military occupation, the French utilized sheer military power, as well as beneficial treaties with some Algerian nationalists, to carry out their conquest. Fighting would not halt until the early 1850s, with approximately half a million Algerians dead, and around 100,000 French dead. Considering the Algerian population at this time was estimated to be a couple million, the military conquest by France proved to be quite devastating for these natives. After this conquest, Algeria was converted into a colony of France, with European settlers traveling to the colony to utilize the land. France would continue to rule most of Algeria for decades to come, occasionally encountering revolts by the native Algerians. These efforts were not enough to quell the forces of France however, and in 1902, the French would ultimately go on to rule all of Algeria in the early 1900s.  

  Although Algeria was a large example of French presence during the “Scramble for Africa”, France also exerted its power in large parts of West Africa. Utilizing Senegal as a “home base”, France colonized surrounding areas such as Guinea and the Ivory Coast. In the late 1800s, France grouped these holdings together into one federation, French West Africa, encompassing Senegal, Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Niger, Mauritania, French Sudan, Upper Volta, and Dahomey. These areas previously came under French control through military expansion, and occasionally agreements with local leaders. Traveling along the Senegal River, French forces would push on in gathering land for themselves, trying to expand their influence as much as possible rather than consolidating the land they already had gained. Eventually, under the new “French West Africa”, a colonial governor was appointed within Senegal to oversee the entire federation. Further positions of power were added in each specific area at a smaller level, to ensure strict power over each.  

  The French were of course motivated by economic reasons in constructing this federation. By capturing large amounts of land and ruling over it as one, the French hoped to construct large scale operations to generate economic benefit. For example, nut and cotton cultivation were operations the French underwent to generate profit. Although the French generated profit, the native Africans themselves did not receive this same benefit. With slavery outlawed at this time, other forms of forced labor were at times used in order to maximize output. Prosperity was allowed for the French, but not for the native Africans.  

  The French also led intrusions into Morocco and Tunisia, further widening their colonial holdings. In 1881, France invaded Tunisia by utilizing its proximity to Algeria. Troops were sent to subjugate the Tunisian inhabitants, and a protectorate was instated through the signing of the Treaty of Bardo. The conquest of Morocco took significantly longer than in the case of Tunisia, beginning in 1907, and not fully coming under French control until 1934. The French, as in Tunisia, established a protectorate in 1912 through the signing of the Treaty of Fes, between France and the Sultan of Morocco. In both cases of protectorates, local autonomy was lessened, enlarging French control over each region. However, these protectorates still allowed significantly more independence than in other French holdings, such as Algeria, due to their status as protectorates.  

  French presence in Africa was relatively long-term, but not permanent. Although France had constructed large-scale operations intended to derive profit and labor, it become more and more difficult to maintain these colonial holdings. The fight for independence was at the forefront of many colonies and their native inhabitants, especially directly after the second World War. In 1944 during the midst of the war, Charles de Gaulle, among leaders of Free France and governors of the French African colonies, organized a meeting to discuss the status of the colonies and establish potential changes to the ways they were governed. Although many key reforms within the colonies were proposed such as equal rights for citizens, and economic reforms, the outright suggestion of overall colonial independence was denied. With this denial of independence to the colonies by de Gaulle, many of these African colonies became increasingly defiant in the years following. In Algeria specifically, a war between French and Algerian liberating forces lasted from 1854-1962, culminating in a referendum recognizing its independence. In the case of French West Africa, the colonies were able to vote for self-government in 1958, and by 1960 the federation itself was dismantled, with each colony becoming their own nation. In Morocco and Tunisia, independence would not ultimately be realized until 1956, as relations slowly became worse in the wake of World War 2. Ideas of nationalism and freedom enabled violent confrontation between the French and natives, culminating in the deconstruction of the protectorates, and recognition of independence by France.
