## **Analysis One, French Colonialism in Africa**

  The history of French presence in Africa started before the actual period dubbed “The Scramble for Africa”, although at a much smaller scale. In the 17th century, France mainly introduced outposts in Madagascar, Senegal, and the Mascarene Islands. These outposts were created to capitalize off slavery, and to gain access to large swaths of natural resources, such as nuts. Later during the Seven Years War, British forces caused turbulence for these French starter colonies, chiefly in Senegal. Although France had constructed some outposts in Africa early on, it would not truly colonize until the mid 1800s with its presence in Algeria.  

  The French first invaded Algeria in 1830, and a full military operation was in order for nearly the next three decades. The French first utilized its navy to form a blockade around Algiers, then taking an approach through land with its army. Although forces within Algeria attempted to resist this military occupation, the French utilized sheer military power, as well as beneficial treaties with some Algerian nationalists, to carry out their conquest. Fighting would not halt until the early 1850s, with approximately half a million Algerians dead, and around 100,000 French dead. Considering the Algerian population at this time was estimated to be a couple million, the military conquest by France proved to be quite devastating for these natives. After this conquest, Algeria was converted into a colony of France, with European settlers traveling to the colony to utilize the land. France would continue to rule most of Algeria for decades to come, occasionally encountering revolts by the native Algerians. These efforts were not enough to quell the forces of France however, and in 1902, the French would ultimately go on to rule all of Algeria in the early 1900s.  

  Although Algeria was a large example of French presence during the “Scramble for Africa”, France also exerted its power in large parts of West Africa. Utilizing Senegal as a “home base”, France colonized surrounding areas such as Guinea and the Ivory Coast. In the late 1800s, France grouped these holdings together into one federation, French West Africa, encompassing Senegal, Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Niger, Mauritania, French Sudan, Upper Volta, and Dahomey. These areas previously came under French control through military expansion, and occasionally agreements with local leaders. Traveling along the Senegal River, French forces would push on in gathering land for themselves, trying to expand their influence as much as possible rather than consolidating the land they already had gained. Eventually, under the new “French West Africa”, a colonial governor was appointed within Senegal to oversee the entire federation. Further positions of power were added in each specific area at a smaller level, to ensure strict power over each.  

  The French were of course motivated by economic reasons in constructing this federation. By capturing large amounts of land and ruling over it as one, the French hoped to construct large scale operations to generate economic benefit. For example, nut and cotton cultivation were operations the French underwent to generate profit. Although the French generated profit, the native Africans themselves did not receive this same benefit. With slavery outlawed at this time, other forms of forced labor were at times used in order to maximize output. Prosperity was allowed for the French, but not for the native Africans.  

  The French also led intrusions into Morocco and Tunisia, further widening their colonial holdings. In 1881, France invaded Tunisia by utilizing its proximity to Algeria. Troops were sent to subjugate the Tunisian inhabitants, and a protectorate was instated through the signing of the Treaty of Bardo. The conquest of Morocco took significantly longer than in the case of Tunisia, beginning in 1907, and not fully coming under French control until 1934. The French, as in Tunisia, established a protectorate in 1912 through the signing of the Treaty of Fes, between France and the Sultan of Morocco. In both cases of protectorates, local autonomy was lessened, enlarging French control over each region. However, these protectorates still allowed significantly more independence than in other French holdings, such as Algeria, due to their status as protectorates.  

  French presence in Africa was relatively long-term, but not permanent. Although France had constructed large-scale operations intended to derive profit and labor, it become more and more difficult to maintain these colonial holdings. The fight for independence was at the forefront of many colonies and their native inhabitants, especially directly after the second World War. In 1944 during the midst of the war, Charles de Gaulle, among leaders of Free France and governors of the French African colonies, organized a meeting to discuss the status of the colonies and establish potential changes to the ways they were governed. Although many key reforms within the colonies were proposed such as equal rights for citizens, and economic reforms, the outright suggestion of overall colonial independence was denied. With this denial of independence to the colonies by de Gaulle, many of these African colonies became increasingly defiant in the years following. In Algeria specifically, a war between French and Algerian liberating forces lasted from 1854-1962, culminating in a referendum recognizing its independence. In the case of French West Africa, the colonies were able to vote for self-government in 1958, and by 1960 the federation itself was dismantled, with each colony becoming their own nation. In Morocco and Tunisia, independence would not ultimately be realized until 1956, as relations slowly became worse in the wake of World War 2. Ideas of nationalism and freedom enabled violent confrontation between the French and natives, culminating in the deconstruction of the protectorates, and recognition of independence by France.  

## **Analysis Two, British Colonialism in Africa**

  The colonization of Africa by European powers was driven by the desire for resources, strategic control, and influence over vast territories. Along the east coast of Africa, the United Kingdom pursued valuable resources such as oil, rubber, and ivory, while also pursuing new land for settlement and agriculture. This push for economic gain and expansion was accompanied by an effort to impose European cultural and social norms on African societies, a mission rooted in ideologies like Social Darwinism and racial superiority. Missionaries, particularly in South Africa, played a complex role in spreading Christianity and European customs, often undermining traditional African practices. Furthermore, English control of the Suez Canal became an important factor in securing trade routes through Africa. This led to heightened tensions with other colonial powers. 

  One of the most important parts of Britain's empire was the colonization of South Africa. The British were able to take control of South Africa in 1795 (Nel, Andreis, British Occupation of the Cape). From there they were able to use this colony as a doorway into India and all of Asia. The strategic location gave safe passage for English merchants to and from Asia and Africa. While there was a lot of trade coming from Asia, South Africa was also good at producing their own resources. Some major resources that came from South Africa were things like ivory, diamonds, and gold. These helped boost the British colony, funding their exploitation and colonization. Ivory is a hard white material that comes from elephants and some of the only places to find it is in Africa especially in the South of Africa where most of them live. The ivory trade was so popular that it was to rival the slave trade and even be more valuable because of how much demand there was for it. 

  South Africa became one of the biggest diamond and gold operations in the world which benefited the British economy heavily. Diamonds are a rare substance that were found mainly in Brazil and India until 1867 when someone found Diamonds in the Orange River sparking a Diamond rush (History of Diamonds: Shimansky). Gold was a minor operation in Africa with some being found in the 1850s, but in the late 1880s on a farm outside of Johannesburg a big load of gold was found starting a major mining operation (Kirk, Jason, The Origin of Gold in South Africa). This helped increase the value of South Africa because the trade route and using South Africa as a pit stop was soon coming to an end with the Suez Canal up for grabs. 

  Near the end of the century one of the most important parts of Africa was finding the best trade routes. The Suez Canal located in Egypt was a key route that many nations fought over to control. In 1859 the French helped the Egyptians start the construction of the canal that would go all the way until 1869. The total cost of the canal at the time cost about $100 million dollars and would translate roughly to $1.5 billion in today’s cost(Suez Canal ‑ Crisis, Location & Egypt.). The British were able to buy 44% of the shares of the Suez Canal from an Egyptian shareholder leaving the French shareholders to still hold a majority of 56% of the shares. The 44% that the English were able to buy was enough though to be able to ban Russia from using the passage. In 1882 riots broke out in Egypt killing English citizens and infuriating the United Kingdom. They decided to step in because they felt that the weak Ottoman Empire was not strong enough to keep peace. So, they decided to intervene and invade Egypt. Once the United Kingdom invaded Egypt, they were able to gain full control over the Canal for the time. In 1888 the Convention of Constantinople was called on where multiple countries including France, Germany, English, Austrian Hungarian, and Ottomans joined. The convention was called because it was to decide the fate of the Suez Canal because it was too valuable, and tensions were growing between nations on who the rightful owner of it should be. The outcome from it was that it shall remain under British protection, but it will be neutral territory for any nation no matter if it is during peace or war times (Constantinople Convention). This allowed for free trade to go through benefiting many countries, especially smaller countries. 

  English colonial endeavors in South Africa, driven by ideas of social Darwinism and a sense of racial superiority, sought to transform African society along European lines. Social Darwinism promoted the idea that Africans were at a lower level of human evolution and that European culture was fundamentally superior by misapplying Darwin's theory of natural selection to human societies. This rationale made it possible for English colonial rulers to force their religion, culture, and values on African communities while frequently ignoring native customs and beliefs. This "civilizing" effort was heavily influenced by missionaries, especially in South Africa. English missionaries believed that Christianity would "save" the local people from what they perceived to be "savage" or immoral customs, thus they worked to convert them. Native languages and traditions were gradually replaced by English, Christianity, and European conventions taught to African youngsters in mission schools. Despite their seeming altruism, missionaries contributed to the solidification of racial hierarchies and the closer alignment of African communities with European colonial goals, resulting in profound and enduring cultural transformations. 

  In conclusion, Africa was significantly and permanently impacted by colonization, especially by the British. Exploiting natural riches like diamonds, gold, and ivory, the British achieved authority over regions like South Africa, motivated by the desire for resources, economic gain, and strategic influence. Many native customs and languages were eradicated during this time as European powers forced their culture and ideology—which was frequently based on social Darwinism—on African societies. British domination was further highlighted by their strategic control of the Suez Canal, which changed trade routes and the world economy. African societies were significantly changed by British colonialism, even though it was presented as a mission of civilization. The socio-economic landscape of Africa is still impacted by this era, serving as a reminder of the colonial past's enduring repercussions.
